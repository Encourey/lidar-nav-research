"""
threads/pipeline.py
───────────────────
Producer-consumer threading pipeline for the navigation loop.

Architecture:
  Thread A (ScanProducer) — continuously reads LiDAR serial data
    and writes the latest Nx2 point array to a shared slot.
  Thread B (main) — reads the latest scan snapshot and runs
    BEV projection + navigation inference independently.

This overlap means YOLO inference time does NOT add to scan
collection time. Result: ~10 FPS vs ~5.6 FPS sequential (v1).

Design choice — shared slot vs queue:
  We use a single shared slot (latest_pts) rather than a Queue
  because for navigation we only care about the most recent scan.
  Stale frames in a queue would increase latency. If the main
  thread is slower than the scan rate, it simply processes the
  most recent available frame and skips intermediate ones.
